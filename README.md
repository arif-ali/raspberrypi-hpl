This is a collection of scripts and configuration that would
allow to compile and run the benchmark in a consistent way

The following will clone, and compile all the stuff

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.arif-ali.co.uk:8543/arif/raspberrypi-hpl
cd raspberrypi-hpl/scripts
./compile_all.sh
```

Then we can run the benchmark using the following script

```bash
./run_job.sh
```
